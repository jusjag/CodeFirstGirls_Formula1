# CodeFirstGirls_Formula1
This is my final project for the Code First Girls SQL Kickstarter course I attended on May-July 2023.

Project included:
- Database of 5 connected tables;
- Some analytic queries;
- Custom view, function, stored procedure;
- ... and also mandatory live presentation showing all of the above.

Chosen dataset:
Formula 1 races from year 1950, from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020).
Why this one?
- as a F1 fan I know how to move around these tables and know what that data actually means,
- since it's all public and well documented, I could double check the results of my queries online

Step 1: Creating database and tables<br>
Database schema:

Step 2: Importing data:
The main table contains over 25.000 rows. Oh, thank you Workbench for the import button!

Step 3: Let's look at the data!

The main table is fully normalised and looks like this:

Computers love it, humans hate it, so as the first step I created a more readable view: 

And just to play a little more, another view using the first one:

Step 4: Analytic queries


Step 5: Procedure - has the driver improved or not?


Step 6: Function - display end results for any chosen year

The hardest part? Giving an online presentation, in english which I haven't spoken for a while... and that weird feeling when I was just speaking to my screen, not seeing the people I was talking to, and not being sure if they still hear/see me :)

That's it!
I learned a lot during this project. And learned even more while dealing with all the errors encountered :)
It was fun!
